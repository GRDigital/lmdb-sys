This flag must be specified\n      when creating the environment, and is stored persistently in the environment.\n\t\tIf successful, the memory map will always reside at the same virtual address\n\t\tand pointers used to reference data items in the database will be constant\n\t\tacross multiple invocations. This option may not always work, depending on\n\t\thow the operating system has allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses.\n\t\tThe feature is highly experimental.\n\t<li>#MDB_NOSUBDIR\n\t\tBy default, LMDB creates its environment in a directory whose\n\t\tpathname is given in \\b path, and creates its data and lock files\n\t\tunder that directory. With this option, \\b path is used as-is for\n\t\tthe database main data file. The database lock file is the \\b path\n\t\twith \"-lock\" appended.\n\t<li>#MDB_RDONLY\n\t\tOpen the environment in read-only mode. No write operations will be\n\t\tallowed. LMDB will still modify the lock file - except on read-only\n\t\tfilesystems, where LMDB does not use locks.\n\t<li>#MDB_WRITEMAP\n\t\tUse a writeable memory map unless MDB_RDONLY is set. This uses\n\t\tfewer mallocs but loses protection from application bugs\n\t\tlike wild pointer writes and other bad updates into the database.\n\t\tThis may be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM, but\n\t\tis slower for DBs larger than RAM.\n\t\tIncompatible with nested transactions.\n\t\tDo not mix processes with and without MDB_WRITEMAP on the same\n\t\tenvironment.  This can defeat durability (#mdb_env_sync etc).\n\t<li>#MDB_NOMETASYNC\n\t\tFlush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the\n\t\tmetadata flush. Defer that until the system flushes files to disk,\n\t\tor next non-MDB_RDONLY commit or #mdb_env_sync(). This optimization\n\t\tmaintains database integrity, but a system crash may undo the last\n\t\tcommitted transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity,\n\t\tconsistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database property.\n\t\tThis flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().\n\t<li>#MDB_NOSYNC\n\t\tDon't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.\n\t\tThis optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or\n\t\tlose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk.\n\t\tThe risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers\n\t\tto disk and how often #mdb_env_sync() is called.  However, if the\n\t\tfilesystem preserves write order and the #MDB_WRITEMAP flag is not\n\t\tused, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation)\n\t\tproperties and only lose D (durability).  I.e. database integrity\n\t\tis maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.\n\t\tNote that (#MDB_NOSYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no\n\t\thint for when to write transactions to disk, unless #mdb_env_sync()\n\t\tis called. (#MDB_MAPASYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) may be preferable.\n\t\tThis flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().\n\t<li>#MDB_MAPASYNC\n\t\tWhen using #MDB_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk.\n\t\tAs with #MDB_NOSYNC, a system crash can then corrupt the\n\t\tdatabase or lose the last transactions. Calling #mdb_env_sync()\n\t\tensures on-disk database integrity until next commit.\n\t\tThis flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().\n\t<li>#MDB_NOTLS\n\t\tDon't use Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to\n\t\t#MDB_txn objects instead of to threads. I.e. #mdb_txn_reset() keeps\n\t\tthe slot reserved for the #MDB_txn object. A thread may use parallel\n\t\tread-only transactions. A read-only transaction may span threads if\n\t\tthe user synchronizes its use. Applications that multiplex many\n\t\tuser threads over individual OS threads need this option. Such an\n\t\tapplication must also serialize the write transactions in an OS\n\t\tthread, since LMDB's write locking is unaware of the user threads.\n\t<li>#MDB_NOLOCK\n\t\tDon't do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the\n\t\tcaller must manage all concurrency itself. For proper operation\n\t\tthe caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure\n\t\tthat no readers are using old transactions while a writer is\n\t\tactive. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that\n\t\tno readers may be active at all when a writer begins.\n\t<li>#MDB_NORDAHEAD\n\t\tTurn off readahead. Most operating systems perform readahead on\n\t\tread requests by default. This option turns it off if the OS\n\t\tsupports it. Turning it off may help random read performance\n\t\twhen the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.\n\t\tThe option is not implemented on Windows.\n\t<li>#MDB_NOMEMINIT\n\t\tDon't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces\n\t\tin the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data\n\t\tfile is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in\n\t\tsubsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized\n\t\tto zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other\n\t\tcode (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the\n\t\tdata file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate\n\t\tand free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may\n\t\tuse the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a\n\t\tmodest performance cost so some applications may want to disable\n\t\tit using this flag. This option can be a problem for applications\n\t\twhich handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory\n\t\tcheckers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with #MDB_WRITEMAP,\n\t\twhich writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The\n\t\tinitialization is also skipped if #MDB_RESERVE is used; the\n\t\tcaller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was\n\t\treserved in that case.\n\t\tThis flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().\n </ul>\n @param[in] mode The UNIX permissions to set on created files and semaphores.\n This parameter is ignored on Windows.\n @return A non-zero error value on failure and 0 on success. Some possible\n errors are:\n <ul>\n\t<li>#MDB_VERSION_MISMATCH - the version of the LMDB library doesn't match the\n\tversion that created the database environment.\n\t<li>#MDB_INVALID - the environment file headers are corrupted.\n\t<li>ENOENT - the directory specified by the path parameter doesn't exist.\n\t<li>EACCES - the user didn't have permission to access the environment files.\n\t<li>EAGAIN - the environment was locked by another process.\n </ul>"]
